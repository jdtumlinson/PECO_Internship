Spring-Summer 2024 Internship: Astronics PECO

This Git Repo contains some of the projects that I completed over the course of my internship at Astronics PECO; an aerospace manufacturing company located in Clackamas, Oregon. While the company specializes in designing and manufacturing Passenger Service Units (PSU's) and Enhanced Vision Systems, I helped to improve the overall flow of the buisness side of the company as a buisness systems analyst (intern).

Over the six month span I interned at PECO, I helped to develope a multitude of different reports and automated services to help our engineering, senior managment, finance, manufacturing, quality, and warehouse teams. These reports ranged from simple goals metrics to more complicated, multi-part applications. These are all covered within these folders.

Due to the confideniality of the company, I am unable to provide direct snippets of code and am required to cover some of the information on screen. This means that this repository is compiled of images of my projects -- with confidential information concealed or heavily altered.
