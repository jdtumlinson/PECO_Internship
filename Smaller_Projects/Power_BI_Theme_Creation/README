Power BI Theme Creation

Introduction
This repository contains the assets and guidelines developed as part of the Power BI Theme Creation project at PECO. Recognizing the absence of a standardized visual theme for Power BI reports within the company, this project was initiated to establish a cohesive and company-branded design language for all Power BI reports.

Project Rationale
The objective was to enhance the user experience across all Power BI reports by implementing a consistent visual standard that embodies the corporate identity of PECO. By doing so, we aimed to eliminate the learning curve associated with adapting to varied report designs and facilitate immediate recognition and familiarity for users.

Importance of Consistency
A unified theme across reports brings several advantages:
    Brand Identity: Reflects PECO's brand consistently in every report.
    User Familiarity: Builds a common visual language for all users, simplifying the navigation and understanding of reports.
    Professionalism: Demonstrates a polished and professional approach to data presentation.
