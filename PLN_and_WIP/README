PLN & WIP Shortages

Introduction
The PLN & WIP (Planned Work & Work in Progress) Shortages report serves as a comprehensive tool, aggregating critical data on order action items and their associated components, as well as visualizing the interplay and demand for these items across various job orders.

Overview
Despite its conciseness as a single-page report, the development of the PLN & WIP Shortages report was a meticulous process that involved innovation in data relationship building and exploration of new methodologies to facilitate dynamic data interaction.

Purpose
The core purpose of this report is to provide a detailed yet clear view of:
    Current shortages in planned projects and ongoing work.
    Individual components that are affecting the order pipeline.
    Relationships and conflicts between job orders competing for the same components.

Development Challenges
Creating a report that could navigate and filter through complex data sets in multiple dimensions posed a significant challenge. The success of the report hinged on the ability to:
    Efficiently connect disparate data tables.
    Allow for traversing these connections in various ways to explore different data relationships.
    Enable advanced filtering to streamline the identification of shortages and conflict points.

Features
    Comprehensive Data Integration: All relevant data regarding PLN and WIP shortages are compiled within a unified interface.
    Action Item Breakdown: The report delineates order action items down to the individual component level.
    Conflict Visualization: It clearly presents competing demands for components by different job orders, aiding in conflict resolution and priority management.
    Dynamic Interactivity: Users are empowered to traverse and filter through the shortage data from multiple entry points and viewing angles.
